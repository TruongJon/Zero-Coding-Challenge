# Zero-Coding-Challenge

 A simple web app that displays a user's provided name in Pig Latin, in addition to the county name and population of a provided zip code.  

## Necessary Packages
Ensures that Python is installed, as well as Node 14.0 or higher

Ensure that NPM is 5.20 or higher, `npm install -g npm`

Install Flask with `pip install flask`

Run `npm install` to install the modules listed in package.json and their dependencies

## How to Start the App

The runtime environment I used was Python 3.9 with Node 16 in Visual Studio Code on Windows.

It is recommended to enter the virtual environment with `venv\Scripts\activate`.

Open the terminal and call `cd backend`

Start the backend server with `python server.py`

Open up another terminal and call `cd client`. 

Call `npm start` to start the web app.
